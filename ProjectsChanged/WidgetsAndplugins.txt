In this project I used:

jQuery-UI widget:datapicker
jQuery-UI widget:autocomplete
jQuery effecets:fadeIn and fadeOut
jQuery plugins:$.fn
jQuery plugins:each()
jQuery plugins:.css()

In first AJAX request ı create my json file and then ı get the datas from json file and implement in table (routes.html page)
In seconde AJAX request I get the information from forismatic.com site and displayed in route pages bottom.

I tried to write clean and understandable codes as much as possible.
Generally, I tried to use that I applied in inclass activites.
For layout and sytling ,I generally tried to choose themes related to water diving(such as I used coral colar or blue). 
If I can create an admin panel, I think universities will have a website for diving and underwater sports.
